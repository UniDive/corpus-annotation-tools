E.g. they may also refer to it as related work (e.g. papers of other annotation editor tools) or have eventually chosen another tool to use.	INCEpTION caters to a wide range of individual users who find different aspects of the tool useful. I would say that probably the ability to link to knowledge bases, the ability to work on sensitive data, the ability to use ML/AI to support the annotation process, the multi-user capabilities, curation support, agreement calculation support, and the range of supported data formats are among the most attractive features.  INCEpTION also caters to institutional users who need to integrate the tool into their existing infrastructure by supporting e.g. single-sign-on mechanisms, docker-based deployment, a remote API, etc.
